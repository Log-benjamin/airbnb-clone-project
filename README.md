<h2>üöÄ Project Overview</h2>

<p>This project is a backend solution for an Airbnb clone, engineered to handle all the essential functionalities of a property rental platform. It provides a scalable and robust foundation for managing users, properties, bookings, and payments. The system is designed to ensure a seamless and efficient experience for both guests and hosts. The API is documented using the OpenAPI standard, offering both RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for flexible data interaction.</p>

<h2>üèÜ Project Goals</h2>

<p>The primary objectives of this project are to:</P>
<ul>
    <li>User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.</li>
    <li>Property Management: Develop comprehensive features for creating, updating, and retrieving property listings.</li>
    <li>Booking System: Create a reliable mechanism for users to book properties and manage their reservations.</li>
    <li>Payment Processing: Integrate a secure payment system to handle all transactional aspects of bookings.</li>
    <li>Review System: Enable users to provide feedback and ratings for properties.</li>
    <li>Data Optimization: Ensure high performance and efficiency through database indexing and caching strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</h2>

<p>The backend of this project leverages a modern and powerful technology stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django: A high-level Python web framework is used for building the robust RESTful API.</li>
<li>Django REST Framework: This toolkit is utilized for creating and managing the RESTful APIs efficiently.[1]</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database serves as the primary data storage.</li>
<li>GraphQL: This query language provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with the backend.</li>
<li>Celery: Asynchronous tasks, such as sending notifications and processing payments, are handled by Celery.</li>
<li>Redis: This in-memory data store is used for caching and session management to improve performance.</li>
<li>Docker: The application is containerized using Docker for consistency across development and deployment environments.</li>
<li>CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines are set up for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring code quality and rapid delivery.</li>
</ul>
